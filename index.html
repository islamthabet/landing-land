        <p class="article-pargraph">
          An ocean is a body of water that composes much of a planet's
          hydrosphere. On Earth ,an ocean is one of the major conventional
          divisions of the World Ocean. These are, in descending order by area,
          the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic
          Oceans. The phrases "the ocean" or "the sea" used without
          specification refer to the interconnected body of salt water covering
          the majority of the Earth's surface. As a general term, "the ocean" is
          mostly interchangeable with "the sea" in American English, but not in
          British English. Strictly speaking, a sea is a body of water
          (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by
          land. Saline seawater covers approximately 361,000,000 km2
          (139,000,000 sq mi) and is customarily divided into several principal
          oceans and smaller seas, with the ocean covering approximately 71% of
          Earth's surface and 90% of the Earth's biosphere. The ocean contains
          97% of Earth's water, and oceanographers have stated that less than
          20% of the World Ocean has been mapped. The total volume is
          approximately 1.35 billion cubic kilometers (320 million cu mi) with
          an average depth of nearly 3,700 meters (12,100 ft). As the world
          ocean is the principal component of Earth's hydrosphere, it is
          integral to life, forms part of the carbon cycle, and influences
          climate and weather patterns. The World Ocean is the habitat of
          230,000 known species, but because much of it is unexplored, the
          number of species that exist in the ocean is much larger, possibly
          over two million.[10] The origin of Earth's oceans is unknown; oceans
          are thought to have formed in the Hadean eon and may have been the
          cause for the emergence of life. Extraterrestrial oceans may be
          composed of water or other elements and compounds. The only confirmed
          large stable bodies of extraterrestrial surface liquids are the lakes
          of Titan, although there is evidence for the existence of oceans
          elsewhere in the Solar System. Early in their geologic histories, Mars
          and Venus are theorized to have had large water oceans. The Mars ocean
          hypothesis suggests that nearly a third of the surface of Mars was
          once covered by water, and a runaway greenhouse effect may have boiled
          away the global ocean of Venus. Compounds such as salts and ammonia
          dissolved in water lower its freezing point so that water might exist
          in large quantities in extraterrestrial environments as brine or
          convecting ice. Unconfirmed oceans are speculated beneath the surface
          of many dwarf planets and natural satellites; notably, the ocean of
          the moon Europa is estimated to have over twice the water volume of
          Earth. The Solar System's giant planets are also thought to have
          liquid atmospheric layers of yet to be confirmed compositions. Oceans
          may also exist on exoplanets and exomoons, including surface oceans of
          liquid water within a circumstellar habitable zone. Ocean planets are
          a hypothetical type of planet with a surface completely covered with
          liquid.

        <p class="article-pargraph">
          The sea, the world ocean, or simply the ocean is the connected body of
          salty water that covers over 70% of Earth's surface (361,132,000
          square kilometres (139,434,000 sq mi), with a total volume of roughly
          1,332,000,000 cubic kilometres (320,000,000 cu mi)).[1] It moderates
          Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon
          cycle, and nitrogen cycle. It has been travelled and explored since
          ancient times, while the scientific study of the
          sea—oceanography—dates broadly from the voyages of Captain James Cook
          to explore the Pacific Ocean between 1768 and 1779. The word sea is
          also used to denote smaller, partly landlocked sections of the ocean
          and certain large, entirely landlocked, saltwater lakes, such as the
          Caspian Sea and the Dead Sea. The most abundant solid dissolved in
          seawater is sodium chloride. The water also contains salts of
          magnesium, calcium, and potassium, amongst many other elements, some
          in minute concentrations. Salinity varies widely, being lower near the
          surface and the mouths of large rivers and higher in the depths of the
          ocean; however, the relative proportions of dissolved salts varies
          little across the oceans. Winds blowing over the surface of the sea
          produce waves, which break when they enter shallow water. Winds also
          create surface currents through friction, setting up slow but stable
          circulations of water throughout the oceans. The directions of the
          circulation are governed by factors including the shapes of the
          continents and Earth's rotation (the Coriolis effect). Deep-sea
          currents, known as the global conveyor belt, carry cold water from
          near the poles to every ocean. Tides, the generally twice-daily rise
          and fall of sea levels, are caused by Earth's rotation and the
          gravitational effects of the orbiting Moon and, to a lesser extent, of
          the Sun. Tides may have a very high range in bays or estuaries.
          Submarine earthquakes arising from tectonic plate movements under the
          oceans can lead to destructive tsunamis, as can volcanoes, huge
          landslides or the impact of large meteorites. A wide variety of
          organisms, including bacteria, protists, algae, plants, fungi, and
          animals, live in the sea, which offers a wide range of marine habitats
          and ecosystems, ranging vertically from the sunlit surface and
          shoreline to the great depths and pressures of the cold, dark abyssal
          zone, and in latitude from the cold waters under polar ice caps to the
          colourful diversity of coral reefs in tropical regions. Many of the
          major groups of organisms evolved in the sea and life may have started
          there. The sea provides substantial supplies of food for humans,
          mainly fish, but also shellfish, mammals and seaweed, whether caught
          by fishermen or farmed underwater. Other human uses of the sea include
          trade, travel, mineral extraction, power generation, warfare, and
          leisure activities such as swimming, sailing, and scuba diving. Many
          of these activities create marine pollution. The sea is important in
          human culture, with major appearances in literature at least since
          Homer's Odyssey, in marine art, in cinema, in theatre and in classical
          music. Symbolically, the sea appears as monsters such as Scylla in
          mythology and represents the unconscious mind in dream interpretation.

        <p class="article-pargraph">
          A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing
          towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river
          flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without
          reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using
          names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no
          official definitions for the generic term river as applied to
          geographic features,although in some countries or communities a stream
          is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to
          geographic location; examples are "run" in some parts of the United
          States, "burn" in Scotland and northeast England, and "beck" in
          northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a
          creek, but not always: the language is vague. Rivers are part of the
          hydrological cycle. Water generally collects in a river from
          precipitation through a drainage basin from surface runoff and other
          sources such as groundwater recharge, springs, and the release of
          stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (e.g., from glaciers).
          Rivers and streams are often considered major features within a
          landscape, however, they actually only cover around 0.1% of the land
          on Earth. They are made more obvious and significant to humans by the
          fact that many human cities and civilizations are built around the
          freshwater supplied by rivers and streams. Most of the major cities of
          the world are situated on the banks of rivers, as they are, or were,
          used as a source of water, for obtaining food, for transport, as
          borders, as a defensive measure, as a source of hydropower to drive
          machinery, for bathing, and as a means of disposing of waste.
          Potamology is the scientific study of rivers, while limnology is the
          study of inland waters in general.

        <p class="article-pargraph">
          A lake is an area filled with water, localized in a basin, surrounded
          by land, apart from any river or other outlet that serves to feed or
          drain the lake.[1] Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean.
          Therefore, they are distinct from lagoons, and are also larger and
          deeper than ponds, though there are no official or scientific
          definitions.[2] Lakes can be contrasted with rivers or streams, which
          are usually flowing. Most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and
          streams. Natural lakes are generally found in mountainous areas, rift
          zones, and areas with ongoing glaciation. Other lakes are found in
          endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts
          of the world there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns
          left over from the last Ice Age. All lakes are temporary over geologic
          time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out
          of the basin containing them. Many lakes are artificial and are
          constructed for industrial or agricultural use, for hydro-electric
          power generation or domestic water supply, or for aesthetic,
          recreational purposes, or other activities.
